## 🚀 Overview

This project is the **client-side user interface** for ProteinMaleki. It includes all UI pages, static assets, and JavaScript logic required to display the platform to end users. The frontend communicates with the backend via secure API endpoints.

The backend API (Django) handles:
- User authentication
- Product data
- Orders and history
- Real-time data updates
- Admin dashboard (not public)

This repo contains only the **frontend code**; everything visible in the UI runs in the browser and fetches data from the secure backend.

This layout follows a classic static frontend pattern with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files organized per functional area.
